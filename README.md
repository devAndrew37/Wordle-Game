# Wordle-Game
Wordle game created on React.

In Wordle you have to guess the word by its letters. A green letter means you guess that positioned letter correctly, a yellow letter means the letter is in the word but not at that position.

Includes a 2 Player mode where one player inputs a word and the other has to guess which word is it. CPU mode gets you a random word to guess.
